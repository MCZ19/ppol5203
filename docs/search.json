The channel serves as an open forum to discuss, collaborate, pose problems/questions, and offer solutions. Students are encouraged to pose any questions they have there as this will provide the professor and TA the means of answering the question so that all can see the response. If you’re unfamiliar with, please consult the following start-up tutorial (https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members). Please follow the invite link to be added to the Slack channel.\nCanvas: A Canvas site (http://canvas.georgetown.edu) will be used throughout the course and should be checked on a regular basis for announcements. ll announcements for the assignments and classes will be posted on Canvas; they will not be distributed in class or by e-mail. Support for Canvas is available at (202) 687-4949\nNOTE: Students are encouraged to run lecture code on their own machines. If you do not have access to a laptop on which you can install python3, please contact the professor and/or TA for assistance. Only python3 will be used in this course.\nDatacamp: As part of this course, you will have access to a DataCamp classroom that you can use to take Datacamp modules for free. Datacamp courses can be a useful tool for you to practice the concepts we see in class. Although I will not assign specific courses for you,, you can use Datacamp courses to review the topics we cover in class. The lecture notes will cover in details all our in-class discussions. Datacamp courses will be considered additional material."

    "text": "Throughout the semester, we will use a combination of tools. This a summary of the main tools:\n\nCommandLine: primarily to interact with git, install programs and run a few scripts\nPython3: for programming taks\nGit/Github: for version control, reproucibility and for sharing materials\nJupyter Notebooks: as a main IDE to work with Python\nQuarto via RStudio: as a secondary IDE (you can make your primary if you prefer) to coding in Python/R/SQL\nSlack: for communication.\n\nLet’s cover how to set up each of these tools in your local machines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you run into issues, please reach out to the Teaching Assistant for assistance\n\n\n\n\nAt times, we’ll use a unix-based commandline. The commandline will feature into our discussion on using git and also running Python programs. If you use a Mac or a Linux operating system, then a functioning commandline comes with your operating system. For Apple machines, this is the Terminal.\nFor Windows (specifically Windows 10), you can enable Linux Bash shell. The following offers a tutorial on how to do this.\nIf you’re using a version of Windows that pre-dates version 10, then Git Bash offers a program will allow you to use git commands from your windows machine.\nLater in the first class, we will cover some concepts of working with the commandline. You can get a full notebook with a intro to commandline in the materials for week 1\n\n\n\nWe’ll use Python3 throughout this course. Below are instructions for downloading Python3 using commandline packages manager (Homebrew for mac, Chocolatey for windows).\n\nInstalling Python3 using Homebrew on a Mac (Apple)\nInstalling Python3 using Chocolatey on a PC (Windows)\n\nAn alternative way to install Python3 is to download an Anaconda distribution. I will use pip rather than conda in the instruction for downloading Python modules. These are simply two ways of downloading and managing open-source software packages. Choose which ever works best for you\nMost computers already have python3 installed. You can check if that is your case through your commandline\npython3 --version\nOn some versions of Windows, you may need to use py instead of python3:\npy --version\nIn either case, the output of this command should be something like Python 3.8.5\n\n\n\nOnce you have Python3 on your computer, you can install a Jupyter Notebook. If you downloaded Python3 using Anaconda, then Jupyter Notebook comes with the distribution and requires no further installation on your part. If you are not using Anaconda, you can install Jupyter notebook running the following code using your commandline.\n# on your command line\npip install jupyter\nYou can then activate a Jupyter Notebook from the commandline by typing:\n# on your command line\njupyter notebook\n\n\nHere is my workflow to open Jupyter Notebooks using the commandline.\n\nOpen the terminal\nNavigate (using cd) to the folder you want to be the root of your jupyter notebook\nOpen the notebook (jupyter notebook)\n\nIt looks like this if I were to open a notebook in the folder I have for this course\n# open terminal\ncd ppol_5203\njupyter notebook\n\n\n\nIf you installed Python using Anaconda distribution system (here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). You can open Jupyter through a point-and-click system. It take forever, but it works!\nIn the lecture notes, you can also find a Introduction to Jupyter notebook. We will cover this in the first class of the course.\n\n\n\n\nA quick digression of the R vs Python debate\nFor some of your classes in the Data Science and Public Policy Masters, you will be using R. Some data scientists and computational social scientists have strong beleifs as to which langugae is better. I, and the DSPP faculty, do not subscribe to that view. Most techniques that are relevent for applied data science can be done in either language.\nIn my personal opinion, R outperforms Python in data manipulation tasks, visualization and statistical modeling. This is because R started out as a statistical programming environment, and that heritage is still visible. Meanwhile, Python started our a general purpose programming language, which was heavily adopted by computer scientists, which means Python outperforms on abstraction, machine learning tasks, working with more complex data types.\nMost importantly, you will be using more one language compared to the other conditional on your career path and the type of tasks you end up working with. If you end up in a team full of computer scientists, it is more likely Python will be your favored language. If you move to work more with social scientists, R will probably be more heavily used. There is no need to chose now. Learn both and broad your horizons. As general programming languages, learning both requires almost the same amount of effort of learning one in isolation.\nBack to the course infrastructure\nIn your classes that are focused on using R, RStudio will be your main IDE. However, RStudio isn’t just for R. It can handle a number of different languages. We can use Python in RStudio using the reticulate package.\nI create a full notebook to teach you how to use Python in Rstudio. Check the intro do quarto notebook. Let’s cover some of the installation steps here:\nTo install RStudio, download from the following link . reticulate is an R package that allows one run a Python REPL in the R console. In addition, it allows one to read in and use Python code, and pass data between R and and Python. The following provides instructions on installing reticulate.\nWith reticulate, you can use Rstudio as a IDE for Python. Another option is to use Quarto (the next-generation version of R Markdown) as an unified framework to generate notebooks with text + code. If you’re an R Markdown user, you will see how Quarto is just an extension of the capabilities that were previously provided by R Markdown. Now, instead of .rmd files, we have .qmd files. Quarto is already installed with RStudio.\n\n\n\nWe’ll go over more Git/GitHub instructions during the second class session. Before that session:\n\nInstall Git if it’s not installed already\nCreate a GitHub account if you don’t have one already (any email and free subscription is fine)\n\n\n\n\nOur course will make use of Slack for internal communication. Enter in our workspace with this link: (https://join.slack.com/t/ppol5203fall2024/shared_invite/zt-2ou5gm0ww-YJUJfR3vTfzN4IuKcULFDQ).\nWhen should you use slack?\n\nInteract with the TAs\nAsk questions to your colleagues\nShare links that are interesting to the discussions in class.\n\nWhen I should not use slack?\n\nIf you have a question you believe will require a longer conversation, I prefer if you can stop by at my office hours\n\nRemember, you don’t need to let me know you are going to my office hours. Just stop by!\nIf you’re new to Slack, check out this tutorial. In the first class, I’ll send out the invitation for everyone to join Slack and we’ll discuss how to use it."

What is the results you want to show? What would be a surprising finding for you?\n\n\n\n\nPresentation\nYou will have the opportunity to present you final project in class. As a Data scientists, your presentation skills are as important as your data skills. You should prepare a 10-12 minutes presentation. It should cover:\n\nMotivation or problem statement\nData collection\nMethods\nResults\nLessons learned and next steps\n\n\n\nProject Report\nThe report is a complete description of the project’s analysis and results. The report should be a 10 page in length (single-spaced; 12pt font) and cover the points presented below. Citations and Front page will not be considered in the 10 page.\nBelow I’ve outlined points that one should aim to discuss in each section. Note that paper should read as a cohesive report:\n\nIntroduction\n\nsummarize your motivation, present some previous work related to your question\npresent your research question\nsummarize your report\n\nData and Methods\n\nWhere does the data come from? – What is the unit of observation? – What are the variables of interest? – What steps did you take to wrangle the data?\n\nAnalysis\n\nDescribe the methods/tools you explored in your project.\n\nResults\n\nGive a detailed summary of your results. – Present your results clearly and concisely. – Please use visualizations instead of tables whenever possible.\n\nDiscussion\n\nRe-introduce your main results\nState your contributions\nWhere do you want take this project next?\n\n\nIMPORTANT: There is not literature review section. You can use the literature to motivate your work. But you don’t need to have a full section on literature review. Read for example, papers at main general interest journals, like here, here and here. All these super accomplished articles do not have long literature reviews."

It represents the effort of RStudio to become a language agnostic IDE for Data Science.\nQuarto main promise is to allow data scientists to run many different languages using the same notebook structure. For the purpose of our course, we will use mostly Jupyter Notebooks, since those are still dominant among Python developers.\nAs you are learning Python and R at the same time throughout your DSPP courses, I advice you to take a look at Quarto. You might find it a useful tool to run both R and Python."

    "text": "Quick tutorial for RStudio\nThis is what RStudio looks like when you open it for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop left pane (input/script)\nThis is your code editor. Here you enter code in any file type (.py, .r, .qmd) you are working on. If not working with notebooks, this is just gonna be a plain text file but with a extension that run the commands.\nFor example, enter 2 + 2 in your script and run a line of code by pressing command + enter (Mac) or Ctrl + enter (PC). This is a huge advantage of Rstudio over Jupyter. You can run your code line by line, instead of running the entire cell.\nBottom left pane (output/console)\nThis is the console. It is pretty much like when you open Python/R from the Command line.\nIn the console, the prompt &gt; looks like a greater than symbol. If your prompt begins to look like a + symbol by mistake, simply click in your console and press the esc key on your keyboard as many times as necessary to return to the prompt.\nRstudio uses + when code is broken up across multiple lines and is still expecting more code. A line of code does not usually end until Rstudio finds an appropriate stop parameter or punctuation that completes some code such as a closed round parenthesis ), square bracket ], curly brace }, or quotation mark '.\nIf the output in your console gets too messy, you can clear it by pressing control + l on both Mac and PC. This will not erase any saved data - it will simply make your console easier to read.\nTop right pane (global environment)\nThis is your environment pane. All objects you create will be displayed here.\nBottom right pane (files, plots, packages, and help)\nHere you find useful tabs for navigating your file system, displaying plots, installing packages, and viewing help pages. Press the control key and a number (1 through 9) on your keyboard to shortcut between these panes and tabs."

We will start our classes with a lecture highlighting what I consider to be the broader substantive and programming concepts covered in the class. From that, we will switch to a mix of coding walk through and breakout group sessions.\nFor every lecture, you will have access to a notebook (.ipynb) covering the topics and code discussed in class. I will upload these materials (which I call lecture notes every day before the class starts). In addition, you will also have access (in at least a week in advance), of required readings (book chapters, articles, blog posts or coding tutorials) for every class. What you will take from this class will be tremendously improved if you work through all these materials.\nNote that this class is scheduled to meet weekly for 2.5 hours. I will do my best to make our meetings dynamic and enjoyable for all parts involved. We will take one or two breaks in each of our lecture."

Your performance in the following aspects will be considered when assessing this part of your grade:\n\nActive involvement during class sessions, fostering a dynamic learning environment.\nContributions made to your group’s ultimate project.\nAssisting classmates by addressing problem set queries through GitHub issues. Supporting your peers will enhance your evaluation in terms of teamwork and engagement\nAssisting classmates with slack questions, sharing interesting materials on slack, asking question, and anything that provides healthy contributtions to the course.\n\nCoding Discussion(5%)\nEvery class will involve some lecture time, and some coding time. The coding time will be divided between me showing you things, and you working on small problem sets. These problem sets are purposefully constructed to help you understand the concepts we go through in class. You participation and involvement in these group exercises will also be part of your grade.\nProblem Sets (50%)\nStudents will be assigned five problem sets over the course of the semesters. While you are encouraged to discuss the problem sets with your peers and/or consult online resources, the finished product must be your own work. The goal of the assignment is to reinforce the student’s comprehension of the materials covered in each section.\nThe problems sets will assess your ability to apply the concepts to data that is substantially messier, and problems that are substantially more difficult, than the ones in the coding discussion in class.\nI will distribute the assignment through a mix of canvas and github. The assignments can be in the form of a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). Students must submit completed assignments as a rendered .html file and the corresponding source code (.ipynb).\nThe assignments will be graded in accuracy and quality of the programming style. For instance, our grading team will be looking at:\n\n\nall code must run;\n\n\nsolutions should be readable\n\n\nCode should be thoroughly commented (the Professor/TA should be able to understand the codes purpose by reading the comment),\nCoding solutions should be broken up into individual code chunks in Jupyter/R Markdown notebooks, not clumped together into one large code chunk (See examples in class or reach out to the TA/Professor if this is unclear),\nEach student defined function must contain a doc string explaining what the function does, each input argument, and what the function returns;\n\n\nCommentary, responses, and/or solutions should all be written in Markdown and explain sufficiently the outpus.\n\n\nAll solutions must be completed in Python.\n\n\nThe follow schedule lays out when each assignment will be assigned.\n\n\n\nAssignment\nDate Assigned\nDate Due\n\n\n\n\nNo. 1\nWeek 2\nBefore EOD of Friday of Week 3\n\n\nNo. 2\nWeek 4\nBefore EOD of Friday of Week 5\n\n\nNo. 3\nWeek 6\nBefore EOD of Friday of Week 7\n\n\nNo. 4\nWeek 8\nBefore EOD of Friday of Week 10\n\n\nNo. 5\nWeek 10\nBefore EOD of Friday of Week 11\n\n\n\nFinal Project (40%): Data science is an applied field and the DSPP is particularly geared towards providing students the tools to make policy and substantive contributtions using data and recent computational developments. In this sense, it is fundamental that you understand how to conduct a complete analysis from collecting data, to cleaning and analyzing it, to presenting your findings. For this reason, a considerable part of your grade will come from a an independent data science project, applying concepts learned throughout the course.\nThe project is composed of three parts:\n\na 2 page project proposal: (which should be discussed and approved by me)\nan in-class presentation,\nA 10-page project report.\n\nDue dates and breakdowns for the project are as follows:\n\n\n\nRequirement\nDue\nLength\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nProject Proposal\nNovember 15\n2 pages\n5%\n\n\nPresentation\nDecember 10\n10-15 minutes\n10%\n\n\nProject Report\nDecember 17\n10 pages\n25%\n\n\n\nImportant notes about the final project\n\nFor the project proposal, you need to schedule a 30min with me at least a week before the due date. For this meeting, I expect you to send me a draft of your ideas. We will do the group assignment and start scheduling meetings by week 4, I will share with you a calendar invite to organize our meetings.\nFor the presentation, You will have 10-15 minutes in our last class of the semester to present you project.\nTake the final project seriously. After you finish your Masters, in any path you take, you will need to show concrete examples of your portfolio. This is a good opportunity to start building it.\nYour groups will be randomly assigned.\n\nSubmission of the Final Project\nThe end product should be a github repository that contains:\n\nThe raw source data you used for the project. If the data is too large for GitHub, talk with me, and we will find a solution\nYour proposal\nA README for the repository that, for each file, describes in detail:\n\nInputs to the file: e.g., raw data; a file containing credentials needed to access an API\nWhat the file does: describe major transformations.\nOutput: if the file produces any outputs (e.g., a cleaned dataset; a figure or graph).\nA set of code files that transform that data into a form usable to answer the question you have posed in your descriptive research proposal.\nYour final 10 pages report (I will share a template later in the semester)\n\n\nOf course, no commits after the due date will be considered in the assessment."

    "text": "Communication\n\nClass-relevant and/or coding-related questions, Slack is the preferred method of communication. Please use the general or the relevant channel for these questions.\nFor private questions concerning the class, email is the preferred method of communication. All email messages must originate from your Georgetown University email account(s). Please use a professional salutation, proper spelling and grammar, and patience in waiting for a response. The professor reserves the right to not respond to emails that are drafted inappropriately. Please email the professor and the TA directly rather than through the Canvas messaging system. Emails sent through CANVAS will be ignored.\nI will try my best to respond to all emails/slack questions within 24 hours of being sent during a weekday. I will not respond to emails/slack sent late Friday (after 5:00 pm) or during the weekend until Monday (9:00 am). Please plan accordingly if you have questions regarding current or upcoming assignments.\nOnly reach out to the professor or teaching assistant regarding a technical question, error, or issue after you made a good faith effort to debugging/isolate your problem prior to reaching out. Learning how to search for help online is a important skill for data scientists.\n\n\nChatGPT and others\nIn the last year, the internet was inundated with popularization of Large Language Models, particularly the easy use of ChatGPT. As a Data Scientist, LLMs will be part of your daily work. I see ChatGPT as Google on steroids, so I assume ChatGPT will be part of your daily work in this course, and it is part of my work as a researcher.\nThat being said, ChatGPT does not replace your training as a data scientist. If you are using ChatGPT instead of learning, I consider you are cheating in the course. And most importantly, you are wasting your time and resources. So that’s our policy for using LLMs models in class:\n\nDo not copy the responses from chatgpt – a lot of them are wrong or will just not run on your computer.\nUse chatgpt as a auxiliary source.\nIf your entire homework comes straight from chatgpt, I will consider it plagiarism.\n\nIf you use chatgpt, I ask you to mention on your code how chatgpt worked for you."

    "text": "Georgetown Policies\n\nDisability\nIf you believe you have a disability, then you should contact the Academic Resource Center (arc@georgetown.edu) for further information. The Center is located in the Leavey Center, Suite 335 (202-687-8354). The Academic Resource Center is the campus office responsible for reviewing documentation provided by students with disabilities and for determining reasonable accommodations in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ASA) and University policies. For more information, go to http://academicsupport.georgetown.edu/disability/\n\n\nImportant Academic Policies and Academic Integrity\nMcCourt School students are expected to uphold the academic policies set forth by Georgetown University and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Students should therefore familiarize themselves with all the rules, regulations, and procedures relevant to their pursuit of a Graduate School degree. The policies are located at: http://grad.georgetown.edu/academics/policies/\nApplied to this course, while I encourage collaboration on assignments and use of resources like StackOverflow, the problem sets will ask you to list who you worked on the problem set with and cite StackOverflow if it is the direct source of a code snippet.\n\n\nStatement on Sexual Misconduct\nGeorgetown University and its faculty are committed to supporting survivors and those impacted by sexual misconduct, which includes sexual assault, sexual harassment, relationship violence, and stalking. Georgetown requires faculty members, unless otherwise designated as confidential, to report all disclosures of sexual misconduct to the University Title IX Coordinator or a Deputy Title IX Coordinator. If you disclose an incident of sexual misconduct to a professor in or outside of the classroom (with the exception of disclosures in papers), that faculty member must report the incident to the Title IX Coordinator, or Deputy Title IX Coordinator. The coordinator will, in turn, reach out to the student to provide support, resources, and the option to meet. [Please note that the student is not required to meet with the Title IX coordinator.]. More information about reporting options and resources can be found on the Sexual Misconduct\nWebsite: https://sexualassault.georgetown.edu/resourcecenter\nIf you would prefer to speak to someone confidentially, Georgetown has a number of fully confidential professional resources that can provide support and assistance. These resources include: Health Education Services for Sexual Assault Response and Prevention: confidential email: sarp[at]georgetown.edu\nCounseling and Psychiatric Services (CAPS): 202.687.6985 or after hours, call (833) 960-3006 to reach Fonemed, a telehealth service; individuals may ask for the on-call CAPS clinician\nMore information about reporting options and resources can be found on the Sexual Misconduct Website.\n\n\nProvost’s Policy on Religious Observances\nGeorgetown University promotes respect for all religions. Any student who is unable to attend classes or to participate in any examination, presentation, or assignment on a given day because of the observance of a major religious holiday or related travel shall be excused and provided with the opportunity to make up, without unreasonable burden, any work that has been missed for this reason and shall not in any other way be penalized for the absence or rescheduled work. Students will remain responsible for all assigned work. Students should notify professors in writing at the beginning of the semester of religious observances that conflict with their classes. The Office of the Provost, in consultation with Campus Ministry and the Registrar, will publish, before classes begin for a given term, a list of major religious holidays likely to affect Georgetown students. The Provost and the Main Campus Executive Faculty encourage faculty to accommodate students whose bona fide religious observances in other ways impede normal participation in a course. Students who cannot be accommodated should discuss the matter with an advising dean."

This a summary of the main tools:\n\nCommandLine: primarily to interact with git, install programs and run a few scripts\nPython3: for programming taks\nGit/Github: for version control, reproucibility and for sharing materials\nJupyter Notebooks: as a main IDE to work with Python\nQuarto via RStudio: as a secondary IDE (you can make your primary if you prefer) to coding in Python/R/SQL\nSlack: for communication.\n\nLet’s cover how to set up each of these tools in your local machines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you run into issues, please reach out to the Teaching Assistant for assistance\n\n\n\n\nAt times, we’ll use a unix-based commandline. The commandline will feature into our discussion on using git and also running Python programs. If you use a Mac or a Linux operating system, then a functioning commandline comes with your operating system. For Apple machines, this is the Terminal.\nFor Windows (specifically Windows 10), you can enable Linux Bash shell. The following offers a tutorial on how to do this.\nIf you’re using a version of Windows that pre-dates version 10, then Git Bash offers a program will allow you to use git commands from your windows machine.\nLater in the first class, we will cover some concepts of working with the commandline. You can get a full notebook with a intro to commandline in the materials for week 1\n\n\n\nWe’ll use Python3 throughout this course. Below are instructions for downloading Python3 using commandline packages manager (Homebrew for mac, Chocolatey for windows).\n\nInstalling Python3 using Homebrew on a Mac (Apple)\nInstalling Python3 using Chocolatey on a PC (Windows)\n\nAn alternative way to install Python3 is to download an Anaconda distribution. I will use pip rather than conda in the instruction for downloading Python modules. These are simply two ways of downloading and managing open-source software packages. Choose which ever works best for you\nMost computers already have python3 installed. You can check if that is your case through your commandline\npython3 --version\nOn some versions of Windows, you may need to use py instead of python3:\npy --version\nIn either case, the output of this command should be something like Python 3.8.5\n\n\n\nOnce you have Python3 on your computer, you can install a Jupyter Notebook. If you downloaded Python3 using Anaconda, then Jupyter Notebook comes with the distribution and requires no further installation on your part. If you are not using Anaconda, you can install Jupyter notebook running the following code using your commandline.\n# on your command line\npip install jupyter\nYou can then activate a Jupyter Notebook from the commandline by typing:\n# on your command line\njupyter notebook\n\n\nHere is my workflow to open Jupyter Notebooks using the commandline.\n\nOpen the terminal\nNavigate (using cd) to the folder you want to be the root of your jupyter notebook\nOpen the notebook (jupyter notebook)\n\nIt looks like this if I were to open a notebook in the folder I have for this course\n# open terminal\ncd ppol_5203\njupyter notebook\n\n\n\nIf you installed Python using Anaconda distribution system (here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). You can open Jupyter through a point-and-click system. It take forever, but it works!\nIn the lecture notes, you can also find a Introduction to Jupyter notebook. We will cover this in the first class of the course.\n\n\n\n\nA quick digression of the R vs Python debate\nFor some of your classes in the Data Science and Public Policy Masters, you will be using R. Some data scientists and computational social scientists have strong beleifs as to which langugae is better. I, and the DSPP faculty, do not subscribe to that view. Most techniques that are relevent for applied data science can be done in either language.\nIn my personal opinion, R outperforms Python in data manipulation tasks, visualization and statistical modeling. This is because R started out as a statistical programming environment, and that heritage is still visible. Meanwhile, Python started our a general purpose programming language, which was heavily adopted by computer scientists, which means Python outperforms on abstraction, machine learning tasks, working with more complex data types.\nMost importantly, you will be using more one language compared to the other conditional on your career path and the type of tasks you end up working with. If you end up in a team full of computer scientists, it is more likely Python will be your favored language. If you move to work more with social scientists, R will probably be more heavily used. There is no need to chose now. Learn both and broad your horizons. As general programming languages, learning both requires almost the same amount of effort of learning one in isolation.\nBack to the course infrastructure\nIn your classes that are focused on using R, RStudio will be your main IDE. However, RStudio isn’t just for R. It can handle a number of different languages. We can use Python in RStudio using the reticulate package.\nI create a full notebook to teach you how to use Python in Rstudio. Check the intro do quarto notebook. Let’s cover some of the installation steps here:\nTo install RStudio, download from the following link . reticulate is an R package that allows one run a Python REPL in the R console. In addition, it allows one to read in and use Python code, and pass data between R and and Python. The following provides instructions on installing reticulate.\nWith reticulate, you can use Rstudio as a IDE for Python. Another option is to use Quarto (the next-generation version of R Markdown) as an unified framework to generate notebooks with text + code. If you’re an R Markdown user, you will see how Quarto is just an extension of the capabilities that were previously provided by R Markdown. Now, instead of .rmd files, we have .qmd files. Quarto is already installed with RStudio.\n\n\n\nWe’ll go over more Git/GitHub instructions during the second class session. Before that session:\n\nInstall Git if it’s not installed already\nCreate a GitHub account if you don’t have one already (any email and free subscription is fine)\n\n\n\n\nOur course will make use of Slack for internal communication. Enter in our workspace with this link: (https://join.slack.com/t/ppol5203fall2024/shared_invite/zt-2ou5gm0ww-YJUJfR3vTfzN4IuKcULFDQ).\nWhen should you use slack?\n\nInteract with the TAs\nAsk questions to your colleagues\nShare links that are interesting to the discussions in class.\n\nWhen I should not use slack?\n\nIf you have a question you believe will require a longer conversation, I prefer if you can stop by at my office hours\n\nRemember, you don’t need to let me know you are going to my office hours. Just stop by!\nIf you’re new to Slack, check out this tutorial. In the first class, I’ll send out the invitation for everyone to join Slack and we’ll discuss how to use it."

    "text": "In-class exercises\n\nTab ATab BTab C\n\n\nLet’s practice with lists first. One way to explore data structures is to learn their methods. Check all the methods of a list by running ‘dir()’ on a list object. Let’s explore these functions using the following list object, by answering the below questions. See here for list methods:\n\n\nlist_exercise = [\"Ramy\", \"Victorie\", \"Letty\", \"Robin\", \"Antoine\", \"Griffin\"] \n\n\n\nAdd “Cathy O’Neil” to the list. Insert “Professor Crast” as the first element of the list\n\n\nRemove “Letty” from the list. Also remove the last element of the list.\n\n\nFind the index of the occurrence of the name “Robin”. Count the number of times None appears in the list.\n\n\nCreate a new list with the names in alphabetical order, copy this list as a new list without changing the values of the original list\n\n\nAdd the string “Lovell” to copied_list and ensure that list_exercise remains unchanged.\n\n\n\nLet’s do a similar exercise with Dictionaries. Consider the dictionary below. See here for dictionary methods:\n\n\ndict_exercise = {\"Ramy\": \"India\",\n                  \"Victorie\":\"Haiti\", \n                  \"Letty\":\"England\", \n                  \"Robin\":\"Canton\", \n                  \"Antoine\":\"Nigeria\", \n                  \"Griffin\":\"China\"}\ndict_exercise\n\n\n\nLook up the keys in the dictionary, and store them in a list object called keys\n\n\nAdd yourself, and two other colleagues in this dictionary. The values are the countries the person in the key was born.\n\n\nRemove “Ramy” from the dictionary, and save as another dictionary\n\n\n\nLet’s now play around with some string methods. See the string below from the book “Babel:An Arcane History”. See here for string methods:\n\nbabel = \"That's just what translation is, I think. That's all speaking is. Listening to the other and trying to see past your own biases to glimpse what they're trying to say. Showing yourself to the world, and hoping someone else understands.\"\n\n\nDetermine if the word “Babel” is present in the string.\n\n\nCount how many times the word “translation” appears\n\n\nConvert the entire string to upper case\n\n\nConvert the pronoum “I” to “We” in the entire text.\n\n\nStrip any punctuation (like commas, exclamation marks, etc.) from the string."

    "text": "In Class-Exercise (Solve on the Lecture Notes)\n\nTab ATab BTab C\n\n\nLet’s practice with lists first. One way to explore data structures is to learn their methods. Check all the methods of a list by running ‘dir()’ on a list object. Let’s explore these functions using the following list object, by answering the below questions. See here for list methods:\n\n\nlist_exercise = [\"Ramy\", \"Victorie\", \"Letty\", \"Robin\", \"Antoine\", \"Griffin\"] \n\n\n\nAdd “Cathy O’Neil” to the list. Insert “Professor Crast” as the first element of the list\n\n\nRemove “Letty” from the list. Also remove the last element of the list.\n\n\nFind the index of the occurrence of the name “Robin”. Count the number of times None appears in the list.\n\n\nCreate a new list with the names in alphabetical order, copy this list as a new list without changing the values of the original list\n\n\nAdd the string “Lovell” to copied_list and ensure that list_exercise remains unchanged.\n\n\n\nLet’s do a similar exercise with Dictionaries. Consider the dictionary below. See here for dictionary methods:\n\n\ndict_exercise = {\"Ramy\": \"India\",\n                  \"Victorie\":\"Haiti\", \n                  \"Letty\":\"England\", \n                  \"Robin\":\"Canton\", \n                  \"Antoine\":\"Nigeria\", \n                  \"Griffin\":\"China\"}\ndict_exercise\n\n\n\nLook up the keys in the dictionary, and store them in a list object called keys\n\n\nAdd yourself, and two other colleagues in this dictionary. The values are the countries the person in the key was born.\n\n\nRemove “Ramy” from the dictionary, and save as another dictionary\n\n\n\nLet’s now play around with some string methods. See the string below from the book “Babel:An Arcane History”. See here for string methods:\n\nbabel = \"That's just what translation is, I think. That's all speaking is. Listening to the other and trying to see past your own biases to glimpse what they're trying to say. Showing yourself to the world, and hoping someone else understands.\"\n\n\nDetermine if the word “Babel” is present in the string.\n\n\nCount how many times the word “translation” appears\n\n\nConvert the entire string to upper case\n\n\nConvert the pronoum “I” to “We” in the entire text.\n\n\nStrip any punctuation (like commas, exclamation marks, etc.) from the string."

    "text": "In Class-Exercise (Use the Lecture Notes to solve)\n\nTab ATab BTab C\n\n\nLet’s practice with lists first. One way to explore data structures is to learn their methods. Check all the methods of a list by running ‘dir()’ on a list object. Let’s explore these functions using the following list object, by answering the below questions. See here for list methods:\n\n\nlist_exercise = [\"Ramy\", \"Victorie\", \"Letty\", \"Robin\", \"Antoine\", \"Griffin\"] \n\n\n\nAdd “Cathy O’Neil” to the list. Insert “Professor Crast” as the first element of the list\n\n\nRemove “Letty” from the list. Also remove the last element of the list.\n\n\nFind the index of the occurrence of the name “Robin”. Count the number of times None appears in the list.\n\n\nCreate a new list with the names in alphabetical order, copy this list as a new list without changing the values of the original list\n\n\nAdd the string “Lovell” to copied_list and ensure that list_exercise remains unchanged.\n\n\n\nLet’s do a similar exercise with Dictionaries. Consider the dictionary below. See here for dictionary methods:\n\n\ndict_exercise = {\"Ramy\": \"India\",\n                  \"Victorie\":\"Haiti\", \n                  \"Letty\":\"England\", \n                  \"Robin\":\"Canton\", \n                  \"Antoine\":\"Nigeria\", \n                  \"Griffin\":\"China\"}\ndict_exercise\n\n\n\nLook up the keys in the dictionary, and store them in a list object called keys\n\n\nAdd yourself, and two other colleagues in this dictionary. The values are the countries the person in the key was born.\n\n\nRemove “Ramy” from the dictionary, and save as another dictionary\n\n\n\nLet’s now play around with some string methods. See the string below from the book “Babel:An Arcane History”. See here for string methods:\n\nbabel = \"That's just what translation is, I think. That's all speaking is. Listening to the other and trying to see past your own biases to glimpse what they're trying to say. Showing yourself to the world, and hoping someone else understands.\"\n\n\nDetermine if the word “Babel” is present in the string.\n\n\nCount how many times the word “translation” appears\n\n\nConvert the entire string to upper case\n\n\nConvert the pronoum “I” to “We” in the entire text.\n\n\nStrip any punctuation (like commas, exclamation marks, etc.) from the string."
