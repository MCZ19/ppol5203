## Where we are ....

-   We started with the basics of being a data scientist:

-   Then we moved over  the primitives of Python as your main DS tool:

    -   Python as a OOP language, Native Data Types in Python
    
    -   Loops, functions, generators, comprehension....
    
- Today we start our journey working with tabular data - a favorite of social scientists!    

## Plans for Today

-   File Management in Python

-   Data as Nested Lists: Motivating Numpy

-   Numpy

-   Intro do Pandas

    -   Series

    -   Acesssing Pandas elements

    -   Creating DataFrames
    
-   Discuss your final project.
    
## File Management in Python

### Main question: how do we read files from our computer in python?

-   Connection management:`open()`, `close()`
-   Reading/writing files 
-   Using `with()` to manage connections.

## Summary

-   **open()**: opens a **connection** with files on our system.

    -   **open()** returns a special item type \*\_io.TextIOWrapper\*
    -   This item is a iterator. We need to go through to convert inputs to a objectin python.

-   **close()**: closes the connection.

-   **write()**: writes files on your system. Also line by line.

-   **with()**: wrapper for open and close that allows alias.


## Example:

```{python}
#| eval: false
# Load libraries
import csv # convert a .csv to a nested list
import os  # library for managing our operating system. 

# Read in the gapminder data 
with open("gapminder.csv", mode="rt") as file:
    data = [row for row in csv.reader(file)]

```

## TLDR:

-   Most often we will use high-level functions from Pandas to load data into Python objects.

-   Why are we learning these tools then?

    -   Very pythonic

    -   No direct equivalent in R or Stata

    -   Important when working non-tabular data - text, json, images, etc..

-   **Reading:** Check Section 3.3 of [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/python-builtin.html) to learn more about the topics covered in the notebook.

# From Nested Data to Dataframes: Motivating Numpy

## Motivating Numpy

So far, all our datatypes we saw are geared more or less towards unidimensional data.

-   string: sequence of words

-   list: sequence of heterogeneous elements

-   dictionaries: key-value combinations.

## Tabular data

![](week4_figs/rectangular_data.png){fig-align="center"}


## Nested Lists

```{python}
# Read in the gapminder data 
import csv
with open("../lecture_notes/week-04/gapminder.csv",mode="rt") as file:
    data = [row for row in csv.reader(file)]


```

## Quizz: What is wrong here?

```{python}
# let's see the data

print(data)

```

## Here comes numpy ...

## Why should you learn? Holds Python together!

## Efficiency

-   Numpy leans toward less flexibility and more efficiency.

-   Lists gives you more flexibility and less efficiency.

-   Allows for easy vectorization of functions

-   Broadcasting for working with arrays with different dimensions

## Materials

-   [Notebook for numpy](/lecture_notes/week-04/_week_4_numpy.html)

-   [Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

-   [Cheatsheet Numpy](https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676302459/Marketing/Blog/Numpy_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)

# Pandas

## Why Pandas?

::: incremental
-   `numpy` offers a great flexibility and efficiency when dealing with data matrices.

-   Really efficient for mathematical operations.

-   Pretty bad for data wrangling tasks ~> `numpy` only accepts the same data type

-   The `pandas` package was designed to solve this limitation by providing data structures to deal with rectangular heterogeneous data type.

-   Main Data Structures: Series and DataFrames
:::

## Pandas Series

A `pandas` series is a **one-dimensional** labeled array.

::: incremental
-   Capable of holding different data types (e.g. integer, boolean, strings, etc.).

-   It holds two key components:

    -   **index**: names in the axis
    -   **values**: values in the series

-   A `Pandas:Series` is nothing but a **column** in an excel sheet or an R `data.frame`.

:::

## Pandas Series Constructor

```{python}
import pandas as pd
s = pd.Series(["Argentina", "France", "Germany","Spain", "Italy", "Brazil"],
                 index=[2022, 2018, 2014, 2010, 2006, 2002])
print(s)
```

You can feed to the constructor:

-   list

-   dictionaries

-   scalar values

-   ndarray

## Pandas DataFrames

A `pandas DataFrame` is a two dimensional, relational data structure with the capacity to handle heterogeneous data types.

-   **relational**: each column value contained within a row entry corresponds with the same observation.

-   **two dimensional**: a matrix data structure

-   **heterogeneous**: different data types can be contained across each column series.

## Constructor

```{python}
import pandas as pd
# create a simple series
series = pd.Series(["Argentina", "France", "Germany","Spain", "Italy", "Brazil"],
                 index=[2022, 2018, 2014, 2010, 2006, 2002])
# create the dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(series)
print(df)
```

# Pandas DataFrames vs R Dataframes

## Important concepts:

-   Creating Dataframes
    -   row-wise: using a list of dictionaries
    -   column-wise: using a dictionaries of lists

-   Indexing for accessing Data Frames in Python
    -   No implicit indexing (**d\[1,2\]**) will throw you an error.
    -   .iloc\[\] = use the numerical index position to call to locations in the DataFrame.
    -   .loc\[\] = use the labels to call to the location in the data frame.

## Final Project

::: incremental
-   **What is it?** A data science project, applying concepts learned throughout the course.

-   Involves collecting data, cleaning and analyzing it, and presenting your findings

-   The project is composed of three parts:

    -   a 2 page project proposal: (which should be discussed and approved by me)

    -   an in-class presentation,

    -   A 10-page project report.
